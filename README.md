# RCWienerBuyer
An AutoIt script I created to automatically detect when [@oscarmayer](https://twitter.com/oscarmayer) posts on their twitter that the Mini Wiener Rovers are for sale, it will then open the link posted in IE (which can easily be automated using AutoIt) and proceed to purchase the item. It does this in ~8 seconds after the tweet was posted.
